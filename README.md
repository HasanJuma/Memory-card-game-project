## Description

**Memory Card Game** is a fun and interactive game that challenges your memory skills. The player is presented with a flexbox of face-down cards, and the objective is to match all the pairs before the time or attempts run out. I chose to create this game because it's a classic game that many enjoy and it's a great way to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with timers in JavaScript.

The game includes:
- A countdown timer (120 seconds)
- A limited number of attempts (20 tries)
- A restart button that appears upon winning or losing
- Fun and colorful card images

## ðŸ§  Game Logic (Pseudocode)

### Game Initialization
- On page load:
  - Select memory cards and UI elements (timer, attempts, message, restart).
  - Shuffle cards randomly.
  - Display attempts and time remaining.
  - Add click events to all cards.
  - Set attempts to 20 and time to 120 seconds.

### Starting the Game
- When the user flips the first card:
  - If the timer isnâ€™t running, start countdown.

### Flipping Cards
- On card click:
  - Ignore click if board is locked or card is already flipped.
  - Flip card to reveal its face.
  - If itâ€™s the first card:
    - Store as firstCard.
  - If itâ€™s the second card:
    - Store as secondCard.
    - Lock the board.
    - Check if the two cards match.

### Matching Logic
- If cards match:
  - Disable further clicks on those cards.
  - Increment matched card count.
  - If all cards are matched:
    - Stop timer.
    - Show win message and restart button.
- If cards do not match:
  - Reduce attempts by 1.
  - If attempts reach 0:
    - Stop timer.
    - Show lose message and restart button.
  - Else:
    - Wait 1.5 seconds.
    - Flip cards back down.
    - Unlock the board.

### Timer Logic

  - Decrement time.
  - If time reaches 0:
    - Stop game.
    - Lock board.
    - Show time-up message and restart button.

### Restarting the Game
